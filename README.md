# Building ML Algorithms From Scratch With Python

So when I started my ML journey, I was less concerned about building these algorithms from the scratch. But recently I decided to explore this option.

I started this exploration by trying to build classification algorithms from scratch.
The first algorithm was LogisticRegression followed by the DecisionTreeClassifier. 

- The LogisticRegression:


I do intend to update this repo with more Machine Learning Algorithms built from the scratch.
